# GoChat

##Brief introduction
This is an APP designed by me during my study of android. This APP is similar to Facebook, WeChat and other social software. Users can chat with their friends online through it. At the same time, we have designed the function of friends circle, and users can share their daily life on the app. Among them, we also added a special function of making friends. We can upload our own contact information, or we can randomly get our own contact information uploaded by a stranger.
##Technical realization
-We use the server as the medium to realize the function of online chat room. At the same time, we rented a cloud server to keep the main messages in the background.(Due to the limited bandwidth and memory of the server, we transplanted some information to the local area. )
-In the information interaction between the android end of this code and the server, we choose to directly obtain the data of the web page, and then cut the string to obtain the required information.
